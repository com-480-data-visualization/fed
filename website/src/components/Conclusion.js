        As our journey through the GreenAce project comes to a close, we reflect
        on the powerful insights gleaned from visualizing the hidden
        environmental costs of professional tennis. By marrying data with
        dynamic visual tools, we have not only highlighted areas for improvement
        but have also empowered players, fans, and organizers to make more
        informed, sustainable choices. Our hope is that this project serves as a
        catalyst for ongoing discussions and actions towards reducing the
        ecological footprint of sports worldwide. Together, letâ€™s continue to
        champion sustainability in every game, for a greener, more responsible
        athletic future.
